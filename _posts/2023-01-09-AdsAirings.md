## Insights
### What is the pod position? Does the pod position number affect the amount spent on Ads for a specific period of time by a company?
1. Pod position is the advertisement slot for the particular show.
2. Pod positions for the ‘Broadcast’ are higher in price than ‘Cable’.

3. Pod position price is also dependent upon shows.
4. Daypart affects the prices most. ‘Prime time’ has the highest prices followed by ‘evening news’.![image1](/assets/img/AdsAirings/Capture(1).JPG){: width="" height="360"}
5. Generally, price decreases as the pod position goes higher for every day part. For ‘early morning’ and ‘evening news’ prices increase with pod positions.![image1](/assets/img/AdsAirings/Capture(2).JPG){: width="" height="360"}


### What is the share of various brands in TV airings and how has it changed from Q1 to Q4 in 2021?

### Mahindra and Mahindra wants to run a digital ad campaign to complement its existing TV ads in Q1 of 2022. Based on the data from 2021, suggest a media plan to the CMO of Mahindra and Mahindra. Which audience should they target?
1. Mahindra and Mahindra should air ads on Early morning, Early Fring to capture the morning audience.
2. They can also assign a little part of the budget to 5 sec and 15 sec ads, as they are cheaper because there may be less demand and as the prices are low they can run more ads with less budget.

## Results
I was able to find the data driven solutions for all the questions that were asked by the stakeholders. Also this project has helped me to revise and polish the knowledge of Advance Excel/ google sheets.

I have used techniques like Advance formulas, filtering, sorting, vlookup, pivot table, charts etc.
