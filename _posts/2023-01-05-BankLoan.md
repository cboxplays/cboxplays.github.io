## Project Description
We have two datasets about loan applicants and their previous applications respectively. In this project we are going to analyze the data with the objective of not missing out on giving the loans to ‘a capable of paying’ applicants so that we will not miss out on possible profit, on the other stop the company from giving loans to ‘fraud’ or ‘not capable of paying’ applicants in order to cut down the losses.
## Approach
### cleaning
1. Take a look at the datasets and get familiar with the fields.
2. Look if there is missing data and figure out the possible way to handle it.
3. Filter the required fields and sort them for the analysis part. 

### Analysis
1. Manipulate or create the required calculated fields for analysis.
2. Perform the statistical analysis on data to find the distributions, correlations to answer the stakeholders questions.
### Visualization and Report
1. Create visual representation of the findings
2. Create detailed report

## Tech-Stack Used
* RStudio - For Cleaning and Data handling
* Tableau - For Analysis and Visualization
* Google Docs - For report

## Insights
### Importing the data to dataframe
```r
application_data <- read.csv("F:/../application_data.csv")
```

### Overview of data
```r
glimpse(application_data)
summary(application_data$NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE)
```

### selecting required fields
```r
application_data <- application_data %>% 
  select(SK_ID_CURR, TARGET, NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE, CODE_GENDER, FLAG_OWN_CAR, FLAG_OWN_REALTY, CNT_CHILDREN, AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE, NAME_TYPE_SUITE, NAME_INCOME_TYPE, NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE, NAME_FAMILY_STATUS, NAME_HOUSING_TYPE, REGION_POPULATION_RELATIVE, DAYS_BIRTH, DAYS_EMPLOYED, DAYS_REGISTRATION, DAYS_ID_PUBLISH, WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START, HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START, REG_REGION_NOT_LIVE_REGION, REG_REGION_NOT_WORK_REGION, LIVE_REGION_NOT_WORK_REGION, REG_CITY_NOT_LIVE_CITY, REG_CITY_NOT_WORK_CITY, LIVE_CITY_NOT_WORK_CITY, ORGANIZATION_TYPE, EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_3, OBS_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_30_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, OBS_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, DEF_60_CNT_SOCIAL_CIRCLE, AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_HOUR, AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_DAY, AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_WEEK, AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_MON, AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_QRT, AMT_REQ_CREDIT_BUREAU_YEAR)
```
### CODE_GENDER analysis
```r
# Changing the variable type of gender to factor
application_data$CODE_GENDER <- as.factor(application_data$CODE_GENDER)

# checking for the unique values
unique(application_data$CODE_GENDER)

# We found ‘XNA’ values, as there count is very low wrt to data we replace them with “F”
application_data <- application_data %>%
  mutate(CODE_GENDER = str_replace(CODE_GENDER, "XNA", "F")) %>% 
  view()
```

### CNT_CHILDREN Analysis
```r
unique(application_data$CNT_CHILDREN)
table(application_data$CNT_CHILDREN)
mean(application_data$CNT_CHILDREN, na.rm = "true")

#As more than 8 kids seems far fetched, we consider them Outliers. There are only few records so we removed them 

application_data <- application_data %>%
  filter(CNT_CHILDREN < 8)
```
### Checking for duplicate records - None found
```r
application_data[duplicated(application_data)]
```

### Converting days in years for DAYS_BIRTH
```r
application_data <- application_data %>% 
  mutate(AGE = round(DAYS_BIRTH * -0.00273973),
         DAYS_BIRTH = NULL)
```
### Managing family status 'Unknown'
```r
view(table(application_data$NAME_FAMILY_STATUS))

application_data <- application_data %>%
  mutate(NAME_FAMILY_STATUS = str_replace(NAME_FAMILY_STATUS, 'Unknown', 'Single / not married'))
```
### dividing income in range buy using CUT() for making range with gap of 25000, and labeled it
```r
application_data$SALARY_RANGE <- cut(application_data$AMT_INCOME_TOTAL,
                                     breaks=seq(0, 500000, by=25000),
                                     labels=c("0-25000", "25000-50000","50000-75000", "75000-100000",
                                              "100000-125000", "125000-150000", "150000-175000", "175000-200000",  "200000-225000", "225000-250000", "250000-275000", "275000-300000", "300000-325000", "325000-350000", "350000-375000", "375000-400000", "400000-425000", "425000-450000", "450000-475000", "475000-500000"))

#converted range to char for further process
application_data$SALARY_RANGE <- as.character(application_data$SALARY_RANGE)
class(application_data$SALARY_RANGE)

#mutate() for replacing null values with "500000 and above".
application_data <- application_data %>%
  mutate(SALARY_RANGE = replace_na(SALARY_RANGE, "500000 and above"))

#Converted back to Factors for levels
application_data$SALARY_RANGE <- as.factor(application_data$SALARY_RANGE)

application_data$SALARY_RANGE <- factor(application_data$SALARY_RANGE, levels = c("25000-50000","50000-75000", "75000-100000", "100000-125000", "125000-150000", "150000-175000", "175000-200000",  "200000-225000", "225000-250000", "250000-275000", "275000-300000", "300000-325000", "325000-350000", "350000-375000", "375000-400000", "400000-425000", "425000-450000", "450000-475000", "475000-500000", "500000 and above"))

#Same process is done for converting credit amount to CREDIT_RANGE
```

### Organized the columns and export dataframe to .csv
```r
application_data <- application_data %>% 
  select(SK_ID_CURR, TARGET,AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, SALARY_RANGE, AMT_CREDIT, CREDIT_RANGE, everything())
write.csv(application_data, "F:/../application_data_clean.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

### Importing dataframe to ‘TableAu’
* <ins>Client Count with Difficulty wrt the Income Range

![image1](/assets/img/BankLoan/Capture(0).JPG)

We found out people are having difficulty in the salary range of 75000 - 225000

So the further analysis is done by focusing on this specific range.

* <ins>Credit distribution across credit range wrt gender

### Importing previous_application data to dataframe
```r
previous_application <- read.csv("F:/../previous_application.csv")
```

### Cleaning and selecting required columns the data
```r
previous_application_clean <- previous_application %>% 
  filter(AMT_CREDIT != 0.0)

previous_application_clean <- previous_application %>% 
  filter(!is.na(AMT_CREDIT))

previous_application_clean <- previous_application_clean %>% 
  select(SK_ID_PREV, SK_ID_CURR, NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_APPLICATION, AMT_CREDIT, AMT_GOODS_PRICE, WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START, HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START, FLAG_LAST_APPL_PER_CONTRACT, NFLAG_LAST_APPL_IN_DAY, NAME_CASH_LOAN_PURPOSE, NAME_CONTRACT_STATUS, DAYS_DECISION, NAME_PAYMENT_TYPE, CODE_REJECT_REASON, NAME_CLIENT_TYPE, NAME_GOODS_CATEGORY, NAME_PORTFOLIO, NAME_PRODUCT_TYPE, CHANNEL_TYPE, SELLERPLACE_AREA, NAME_SELLER_INDUSTRY, CNT_PAYMENT, NAME_YIELD_GROUP, PRODUCT_COMBINATION)
```

### Merging application_data and previous_application_clean dataframes
```r
merge_loan <- merge(application_data, previous_application_clean, by="SK_ID_CURR")

# Renaming, sorting and filtering required fields
merge_loan <- merge_loan %>% 
  rename("AMT_CREDIT"="AMT_CREDIT.x", "NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE"="NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE.x", "AMT_ANNUITY"="AMT_ANNUITY.x", "AMT_GOODS_PRICE"="AMT_GOODS_PRICE.x", "WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START"="WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START.x", "HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START"="HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START.x", "NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE_PREV"="NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE.y", "AMT_ANNUITY_PREV"="AMT_ANNUITY.y", "AMT_CREDIT_PREV"="AMT_CREDIT.y", "AMT_GOODS_PRICE_PREV"="AMT_GOODS_PRICE.y", "WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START_PREV"="WEEKDAY_APPR_PROCESS_START.y", "HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START_PREVC"="HOUR_APPR_PROCESS_START.y")

```
### Exporting merged dataframe
```r
write.csv(merge_loan, "F:/../merge_loan.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```

### Importing dataframe to ‘TableAu’

### In R, filter the required fields and find the correlation matrix for the merge_loan
```r
merge_loan_corr <- merge_loan %>% 
  select("CNT_CHILDREN", "AMT_INCOME_TOTAL", "AMT_CREDIT", "REGION_POPULATION_RELATIVE", "AGE", "DAYS_EMPLOYED", "DAYS_REGISTRATION", "DAYS_ID_PUBLISH", "AMT_APPLICATION", "AMT_CREDIT_PREV", "DAYS_DECISION", "SELLERPLACE_AREA")
  
cr <- cor(merge_loan_corr)

# Create the heat map of the correlation matrix using corrplot library.
corrplot(cr,
         type = "upper",
         is.corr = FALSE,
         col = colorRampPalette(c("white","white", "grey", "black"))(100),
         method = "color",
         tl.col = "black",
         tl.cex=0.5,)
```

![image1](/assets/img/BankLoan/CorrMatrix.jpg){: width="" height="360"}

## Results
1. There were missing data that was handled by filtering it as the count of missing value was less with respect to the data
1. We found out people are having difficulty in the salary range of 75000 - 225000.
1. Large number of  people have payment difficulty who are asking for a loan above 900000 followed by 250000-300000 and 500000-550000.
1. Distribution of income sources is quite equal in both the genders.
1. People are preferring ‘Cash Loans’ instead of ‘Revolving Loans’ as a result more people are having payment difficulty in ‘Cash Loans’.
1. The presumption was people with less Annuity will have payment difficulty. According to analysis, we can see there is a really weak connection between Annuity and payment difficulty.
1. More people who are ‘Married’ and education is ‘Secondary / secondary special’  are having payment difficulty.
1. Approval rate is higher than rejection rate across both contact types.
1. Approval rate and rejection rates are similar across both genders.
1. About ‘Product Combination’, ‘POS Household with Interest’ having highest applications and ‘Cash’ is having lowest applications.
1. Highest loan amount is asked for Co-op Apartments by the people with ‘Lower Secondary' education.
1. ‘Current amount asked and credit given previously’ shows great correlation. Followed by ‘age and employed days’.
